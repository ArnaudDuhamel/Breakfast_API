# Breakfast API

This project is the recreation of the following [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmDJIooZjBE), but in Dotnet 8.

To run the project, go to the ```BuberBreakfast``` folder and run the command ```dotnet run```.

The folder ```Requests/Breakfast``` contains requests that can be used to test the API.
